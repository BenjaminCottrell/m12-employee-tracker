  # M12-Employee-Tracker

  ## Description
  Employee Tracker is a command line interface application that takes a user's input to update a database. It was made for practice in mySQL. This project allows the user to view, update, and add employees, roles, and departments. During this project I learned to:
  
  - Utilize mySQL for databases

  - Create, read, update and delete from a database

  - Display tables in the command line interface
